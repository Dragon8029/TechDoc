      <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It describes and defines the content of a webpage along with the basic layout of the webpage. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/ behavior (JavaScript).</p>
      <p>"HyperText" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.</p>
      <p>HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such as &lthead&gt, &lttitle&gt, &ltbody&gt, &ltheader&gt, &ltfooter&gt, &ltarticle&gt, &ltsection&gt, &ltp&gt, &ltdiv&gt, &ltspan&gt, &ltimg&gt, &ltaside&gt, &ltaudio&gt, &ltcanvas&gt, &ltdatalist&gt, &ltdetails&gt, &ltembed&gt, &ltnav&gt, &ltoutput&gt, &ltprogress&gt, &ltvideo&gt and many others.</p>

      <header>Prerequisites</header>
      <p>Before starting this module, you don't need any previous HTML knowledge, but you should have at least basic familiarity with using computers and using the web passively (i.e., just looking at it and consuming content).</p>

      <header>What is HTML?</header>
      <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language; it is a markup language used to tell your browser how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wishes it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of the content to make it appear or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a bit of content into a hyperlink to link to another page on the web, italicize words, and so on. </p>

      <p>The main parts of our element are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the start of the paragraph is.</li>
        <li>The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the end of the paragraph is. Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error and can lead to strange results.</li>
        <li>The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case is just text.</li>
        <li>The element: The opening tag plus the closing tag plus the content equals the element.</li>
      </ol>

        <header>Nesting Elements</header>
        <p>You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" in a &ltstrong&gt element, which means that the word is to be strongly emphasized:</p>
        <p>&ltp&gtMy Cat is &ltstrong&gtvery&lt/strong&gt grumpy.&lt/p&gt</p>
        <p>You do however need to make sure that your elements are properly nested: in the example above, we opened the p element first, then the strong element, therefore we have to close the strong element first, then the p. The following is incorrect:</p>
